Welcome to my portfolio! 

Here you can find the data visualizations that have been published with my -- or a colleague's -- journalistic work. 

# What kind of data journalism do you do?

I am a freelance reporter who covers business and finance policy, mostly about technology. Most of my work has to do with regulations and reports of different markets. Occasionally I assist with another journalist's work, which could be for any type of topic. 

# Cmon, don't gatekeep your skills. 

How do I do it? Some of it is good old fashion Google searches and excel spreadsheets. Also, the occasional data scraping and Python magic tricks. I also consult experts to make sure the data I am using is displayed properly. Some tools I use are:
* Python / VSCode
* DataWrapper
* Adobe Illustrator & InDesign
* Good ole ChatGPT
* Github Copilot is fun to try, too, but usually, I am only uploading to this repo, not coding within it.

# What kind of career are you looking for? 

I completed some of my M.S. Journalism from Northwestern University (Exactly half of it; 2 quarters; 7 credits out of 13.5). I am stepping away from my degree [insert gasps and accusations of blasphemy here] because I have decided that at the end of the day, I want to invest more time and money into learning technical skills like data and business analytics, product management, research development, and more. For most of my life, I've had so many people who tell me what a strong writer I am, what a great speaker, a good leader, and a communicator, so I stuck to what I knew I was always praised for. It wasn't until recently that I was empowered to explore my aptitude for explaining really complex -- and sometimes boring -- topics through data, analytics, and business/product growth. I remember in high school I was elected president of the National English Honor Society because in my speech I talked about how much I loved reading so I could write research papers. At the time I thought that meant I was a creative brain and I had completely discredited my analytical side. So, admittedly I don't want to pigeonhole myself into a job title. What I really want is the autonomy to go out there, find some cool data, explain why people should care about it, and hopefully have some level of fulfillment about it. Fulfillment for me could be a product that was made from the data I got, venture capital funding that came in because I articulated the market segmentation and competitive advantage best, a byline in an online news publication, a research paper that I contributed to, policy change, or general awareness and public use.

# What has gotten you here? 

Curiosity, mainly. And a lot of Linkedin, ironically. Check out my actual professional documents below, instead of my rambling above. And, thanks for reading.
